description: Nna Katharine Green (1846-1935) was an American poet and novelist. She
  was one of the first writers of detective fiction in America and distinguished herself
  by writing well plotted, legally accurate stories (no doubt assisted by her lawyer
  father). Born in Brooklyn, New York, her early ambition was to write romantic verse,
  and she corresponded with Ralph Waldo Emerson. When her poetry failed to gain recognition,
  she produced her first and best known novel, The Leavenworth Case (1878). She became
  a bestselling author, eventually publishing about 40 books. She was in some ways
  a pro.
